The PC-VQA dataset contains 38,400 paired comparisons of the LIVE dataset from 209 random observers. An attractive property of this dataset is that the paired comparison data is complete and balanced. As LIVE includes 10 different reference videos and 15 distorted versions of each reference (obtained using four different distortion processes ¡ª MPEG-2 compression, H.264 compression, lossy transmission of H.264 compressed bitstreams through simulated IP networks, and lossy transmission of H.264 compressed bitstreams through simulated wireless networks), for a total of 160 videos, the complete comparisons of this video database requires 10 * 120 = 1200 comparisons. Therefore, 38,400 comparisons correspond to 32 complete rounds (38400 = 32*1200).

If you want to test your method on this dataset, please load the paired comparison data (e.g. data1.mat file contains 3840 paired comparisons for reference video 1).  The first column in data1.mat is the video ID with better quality and the second column is the video ID with worse quality.
